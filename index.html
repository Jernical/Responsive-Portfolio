                Hey, my name is Suraj Patel I was born on July 13, 1998 in the city of Philadelphia, I have two amazing sisters who obviously I didn't get along with; like any
                brother and sister. My parents are actually native to India but me and my sisters were born in america. As of right now, I am a resident of Burlington in North Carolina.
                My hobbies include playing video games, watching football, and as of 2019 I began indulging myself in coding. I never thought I would of found anything that would keep me engaged as
                gaming did until I found my passion for coding. The complexity behind writing code is daunting at first but once overcome coding has a satisfaction to rival my complex thoughts about
                certain games.
            </p>
            <p>
                In undergraduate Math courses where I excelled, I immersed myself in mentorship as I felt a responsibility to contribute my knowledge to help my peers also excel. I spent time providing
                instruction to help students apply fundamentals to modern principles using communication. Using observations and reasoning, I explained how certain concepts can be applied.
                Although my classmates were learning from my assistance, it was also a learning experience for me, as I continued to build leadership skills.
                This allowed me to proficiently mentor, a quality I hope to apply in the field of coding by engaging in teamwork and interactive learning.
                My long-term goal is to one day develop a Video Game or be on an development team for one, whether that be a mobile game or a PC one. As of short-term I am just hoping to finish my studies at UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp.
