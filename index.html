            <p>
                Passionate and self-motivated Full Stack Web Developer designing, building, and maintaining efficient, reusable, and reliable code for scalable applications. 
                Proven ability to learn information quickly and communicate it in an easy to understand format. Successful experience working directly with employees and 
                customers to assist in problem resolution. Strong problem-solving skills with the ability to deliver solutions to ensure customer/employee satisfaction.
                I am passionate about coding because of how there are many different ways to accomplish one goal. I believe every day is a new day to learn more 
                and find faster, more efficient techniques to accomplish your task. 
                    "A day without learning is a day wasted" - Albert Einstein

                My hobbies include playing video games, watching football, and as of 2019 I began indulging myself in coding. I never thought I would of found anything that would keep me engaged as
                gaming did until I found my passion for coding. The complexity behind writing code is daunting at first but once overcome coding has a satisfaction to rival my complex thoughts about
                certain games.
